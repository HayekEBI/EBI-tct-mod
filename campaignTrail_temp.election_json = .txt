The The National Rejuvenation Act, The Blayre Declaration and many other bills have been enacted. The UEl's polling has collapsed. And it is expected for the party to gain halve of the votes they got last election. The two parties who are currently in the lead in polls are the NLU and the CUA. It looks to be a tight race between the two parties. So who will win the election? Only time can tell .",
